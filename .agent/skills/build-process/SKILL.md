# Build Process Instructions

The user prefers to manually run the build process (`npm run build`, `git push`, etc.) themselves.

**DO NOT** automatically run `npm run build` or `git push` unless explicitly asked.
**DO NOT** ask for permission to run these commands for standard tasks.

Instead, simply notify the user when the code changes are complete and ready for them to build/deploy.
